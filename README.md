# ML_models_from_scratch
This repository is for machine learning models created by hand, i.e. without specific libraries. 

1. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/evylegzhanin/ML_models_by_hand/tree/main/Linear_Regression) (one variable + multiple variables cases)
2. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/evylegzhanin/ML_models_by_hand/tree/main/Logistic_Regression) (simple logistic regression + Feature mapping + Regularization)
3. SVM
4. Naive Bayes classifier
5. K-Means
6. PCA
7. Tree
