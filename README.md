# Machine and Deep Learning models from scratch
This repository is for machine and deep learning models created by hand, i.e. without specific libraries. 

**Machine Learning models:**
1. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/evylegzhanin/ML_models__from_scratch/tree/main/linear_regression) (one variable + multiple variables cases)
2. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/evylegzhanin/ML_models__from_scratch/tree/main/logistic_regression) (logistic regression + feature mapping + regularization)
3. [K-Means](https://github.com/evylegzhanin/ML_models__from_scratch/tree/main/kmeans) (clustering with sklearn.datasets.make_blobs + elbow method)
4. Naive Bayes classifier
5. PCA
6. Tree
7. Random Forest
  
**Deep Learning models:**
1. Simple Neural Network

**Other models:**
1. [Word2vec](https://github.com/evylegzhanin/ML_DL_models_from_scratch/tree/main/word2vec) (word2vec based on Skip-Gram. Only theory by now) - NLP
